# Projects
Random projects I've played around with.

## [Recipes App](doc/README.md)
A basic website made using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Made this in an afternoon to sort, store and view all of my recipes. Inspired by friends asking me for meal ideas.
Visit the site [ebruesewitz.github.io/Projects/](https://ebruesewitz.github.io/Projects/) to view the (VERY SIMPLE) finished product.
