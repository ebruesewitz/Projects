# Projects
Random projects I've played around with.

## [Recipes App](docs)
A basic website made using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Made this in an afternoon to sort, store and view all of my recipes. Inspired by friends asking me for meal ideas.
Visit the site [ebruesewitz.github.io/Projects/](https://ebruesewitz.github.io/Projects/) to view the (VERY SIMPLE) finished product.

## [Spotify Web App](Spotify)
Simple music discovery app using HTML, CSS, and JS to play with Spotify's API. 
Allows a user to search for an artist and view their top 10 songs and any related artists.
If a preview is available for the top songs, the user can click on them to hear a 30 second preview.
